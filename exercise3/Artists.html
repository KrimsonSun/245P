                </hgroup>
                <p>A cornerstone of the 1990s "Golden Era," Nas cemented his legendary status with his debut album,
                    *Illmatic*, at just 20 years old. Known for his dense, complex, and poetic rhymes, Nas provides
                    panoramic views of street life, philosophical introspection, and the black experience in America,
                    setting a high standard for lyrical artistry.</p>

                <p>Hailing from Compton, California, Kendrick Lamar is widely regarded as one of the most influential
                    rappers of the 21st century. His albums, such as *To Pimp a Butterfly* and *DAMN.*, weave intricate
                    narratives addressing socio-political issues, racial identity, and personal struggle, earning him a
                    Pulitzer Prize in 2018.</p>
