/* --- 1. Top Row (Alignment Fix) --- */
/* REQUIREMENT: The top row (.left + .right) must be pushed right by 5% to align with the content area of the bottom row.
   The bottom row's .center boxes have a 5% margin-left (and margin-right) from the original CSS.
   Adding margin-left: 5% to the first item (.left) shifts the entire 90% wide block over, 
   creating the necessary 5% left gap and achieving alignment. (5% margin + 45% + 45% = 95% used width, leaving 5% on the right).

    margin: 0; /* Remove potential original margins from .inner */

/* --- 3. Top-Right Corner Positioning (.right - Yellow Box, Green Inner) --- */
/* REQUIREMENT: Green inner box (.inner) organized to the top right corner, text aligned to the left, color purple. */
.right {

    align-items: flex-start; /* Pushes content (.inner) to the top */

       if the viewport is too small, as it has a larger height than .left */

/* --- 4. Bottom Center Positioning (.center - Red Box, Blue Inner) --- */
/* REQUIREMENT: Blue inner box (.inner) horizontally and vertically centered within the red box (.center). Text is also centered. */

/* .center is the red box container and acts as the Flex container for internal centering */
.center {
    display: flex; 
    justify-content: center; /* Center .inner horizontally */

    height: 60%;
    margin: 0; /* Important: Override original margin to allow perfect centering */
