        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>Released in 2018, A$AP Rocky’s *Testing* is arguably his most ambitious and polarizing project. True to its title, the album served as a platform for sonic experiments, moving away from conventional Trap while retaining heavy bass and psychedelic soundscapes.</p>
        <p>The record is built on chaos and collision, incorporating rock, Moby samples, and Grime influences, which resulted in a sprawling, yet often fragmented, vision of modern hip-hop. While inconsistent, its high points, such as "Praise The Lord," solidified Rocky's position as an avant-garde figure.</p>

        <h2>Long.Live.A$AP</h2>
        <p>Released in 2013, *Long.Live.A$AP* served as Rocky’s major-label debut, successfully translating his psychedelic Trap sound to a mainstream audience. The album maintained his Houston-influenced dark beats while showing versatility through collaborations with artists like Skrillex and Santigold.</p>
        <p>Tracks like "Goldie" and "F**kin' Problems" cemented his status as a fashion-forward, yet musically grounded, star. This record was critical in establishing his reputation for blending Southern production with his New York swagger and experimental tendencies.</p>

        <h2>Don't be dumb</h2>
        <p>"Don't Be Dumb" represents more than just a song; it is the working title for A$AP Rocky’s highly anticipated, unreleased studio album. The title encapsulates his sharp, often confrontational, attitude toward the music industry and his experimental approach to his latest body of work.</p>
        <p>Beyond the music, Rocky’s partnership as Creative Director for **PUMA's F1 division** solidifies his status as a key figure bridging high fashion, Hiphop, and motorsport culture. This role emphasizes his broader artistic vision, treating fashion and design with the same experimental energy as his music.</p>
